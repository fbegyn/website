# Personal website

This is where I will eventually have the source code for my own little place on the interwebs.

## Blog

Blog posts can be written in markdown and stored in the `./blog` directory. The blog posts can have
the following frontmatter:

```
---
title: "<title>"
date: <date>
tags:
 - <tag 1>
 - <tag 2>
 - ...
---
```

or in the following format:

```
---
title: "<title>"
date: <date>
tags: [<tag 1>, <tag 2>, ...]
---
```

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve done a post about DSCP before but it got lost and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t proper anyways. So here&amp;rsquo;s another one which will be better documented and hosted on my github (that way it&amp;rsquo;s better preserved). So let&amp;rsquo;s get to it.
DSCP? First of all, what is DSCP?
DSCP stand for Differentiated Services Code Point and is used to identify &amp;ldquo;services&amp;rdquo; straight from the IP header. DSCP is carried in the Differentiated Services (DS) field and together with the ECN field (which occupies the lower 2 bits) is carried in the legacy ToS field of the IP header.</description>

      <title>Making debian packages on Arch Linux</title>

      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been helping with a little APT repo, and it&amp;rsquo;s been fun. The thing I struggled a bit with was making a .deb package on my system (&amp;ldquo;Hey, did you know I use Arch Linux?&amp;rdquo;). Not because this is badly documented, but a lot of the documentation is actually making use of devscripts, dh_make or other helpers, which for some unkown reason all refuse to work on my system.</description>

      <title>Docker, trustworthy or shady?</title>

      <description>When I saw the article about docker images on dockerhub being infected with cryptocurrency mining malware, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but write something about my feelings about docker.
Docker? According to wikipedia
 Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization also known as containerization.[6] It is developed by Docker, Inc.[7] Docker is primarily developed for Linux, where it uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces, and a union-capable file system such as OverlayFS and others[8] to allow independent &amp;ldquo;containers&amp;rdquo; to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines (VMs).</description>

      <title>Setting up a reverse proxy, traefik</title>

      <description>So I run a few services at home, primarily for testing and development only. I simply do not have the infrastructure or network to do so for anything I deem important. That said, being able to test some things quickly on a system where I have to care little about introducing breaking changes is very handy (not that I often do, just when it happens I don&amp;rsquo;t do it on production :p ).</description>

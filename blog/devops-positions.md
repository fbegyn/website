# Why I'm wary of "devops" positions

People that know me, know that I can go of on a rant about "devops" positions.
They ask me about it so often, that I decided to put the opinion into a
blog post. So here's a short summary of my frustrations about current job market
for "devops", also known as a rant:

Little bit of context: I recently was on a job hunt for a little period, during
which I took about 40 interviews at a wide range of companies. Some I took
serious, others where done out of curiousity, as practice or as long shots for
positions that I didn't feel qualified for. Most of these interviews were
terrific and I got to talk to some very bright and friendly people. My problem
lays with the term "devops" being used for an incredibly broad spectrum of jobs.

A lot of these positions had "devops" in some capacity in their titles and let me
start of that this in itself is already a red flag for me. Having a single
person/team doing both development and operations isn't devops, since there are
few people in the world who can match the expectation of being good at both. I'm
of the opinion that "devops" is something that the entire company should
practice, devops is about breaking down the old ideas that development and
operations are separate ideas that live seperately from each other, devops is
about creating a communication workflow between these 2 sides (dev and ops) that
have traditionally been separated.

Some have taken this concept of "devops" and distilled it down to a job
description/title, while in reality that's not possible. How do you boil down all
the ideas, communication, principles and culture of a movement into a little
description/title? You don't and you shouldn't. Attempting it goes against the
core of the movement.

Something else that I noticed, is that some people think an ops team can can be
replaced by devops. Which, as you might notice, does not match with the ideas
that I described above. You can't facilitate communication between 2 teams when 1
team simply doesn't exist.

# OK, but how to we solve this?

There are several options to solve this problem:

1. **Start recruiting devops people, not devops titles**: Recruit the people you
  need to recruit for the job you need. If you want to have devops within the
  company, every potential hire should match the culture in the company.
  
2. **Start facilitating devops mentality**: Recruiting devops oriented people is
  a way to introduce devops to a company. But just recruiting them and expecting
  them to completely do all the "devops" things in the company are leaving them
  to fight a battle completely on their own is a good way to lose those people
  fast.
  
3. **Give people space to practice devops**: The best way to learn devops, is by
  doing some dev/ops when you're in a ops/dev position. You'll find out that
  sysadmins become a lot more reasonable when they understand the software they
  are running on servers. And developers will consider the implications of design
  decisions a bit more once they've been called out of bed because there feature
  crashed production.
  
4. **Devops isn't magic**: Devops isn't some magical solution you can throw at a
  problem and expect it to be fixed. It takes time, knowledge and hard work to
  implement the methods and tech, but in the end, I do believe the rewards are
  worth the effort.

I normally mention the sources without context. But below are some blog posts
that share my idea and frustration with current trends in companies.

  broad devops can be and how it means different things to different people.
* [Life without ops](https://ma.ttias.be/life-without-ops/) some insight into how
  devops can't replace an ops team.

  disaster](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/platform-engineer-twilio-ask-your-developer-excerpt)
  lightly touches on devops and then goes into detail about more specific job
  titles that all practice devops principles, but have different focuses
  depending on what the company needs (platform engineer, SRE, release engineer,
  ...)

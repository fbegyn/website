# Why I'm wary of "devops" positions

People that know me, know that I can go of on a rant about "devops" positions.
They taunt and ask me about it so often, that I decided to put the opinion into a
blog post. So here's my rant:

Little bit of context: I recently was on a job hunt for a little period, during
which I took 37 interviews at a wide range of companies. Some I took serious,
others where done out of curiousity, as practice or as long shots for positions
that I didn't feel qualified for.

A lot of these positions had "devops" in some capacity in their titles and let me
start of that this in itself is already a red flag for me. Creating a team for
this seems silly. Having a single person/team doing both development and
operations isn't devops, since there are few people in the world who can match
the expectation of being good at both development and ops. I'm of the opinion
that "devops" is something that the entire company should practice, devops is
about breaking down the old ideas that development and ops are separate ideas
that live seperately from eachother, devops is about creating a communication
workflow between these 2 sides (dev and ops) that have traditionally been
separated.

Some have taken this concept of "devops" and distilled it down to a job
description/title, while in reality that's not possible. How do you boil down all
the ideas, communication, principles and culture of a movement into a little
description/title? You don't and you shouldn't. Attempting it goes grossly
against some of the principles of the movement.

# OK, but how to we solve this?

There are several options to solve this problem:

1. **Stop using devops titles, recruit devops people**: Recruit the people you
  need to recruit for the job you need. Need a developer? Put out ads for
  developers that has an intrest in putting software out of the door fast and
  reliable. Have infrastructure that needs handling, but also want to speed up
  deployment? Hire a sysadmin that has some interest in development
  
2. **Give people space to practice devops**: The best way to learn devops, is by
  doing some dev/ops when you're in a ops/dev position. You'll find out that
  sysadmins become a lot more reasonable when they understand the software they
  are running on servers. And developers will consider the implications of design
  decisions a bit more once they've been called out of bed because there feature
  crashed production.
  
3. **Devops doesn't replace ops, or developers**: Devops isn't some magical
  solution you can throw at a problem and expect it to be fixed. Hire good
  developers and sysadmins and practice point 2

# Sources

I normally let mention the sources without context. But below are some blog posts
that share my idea and frustration with current trends in companies. There was
another one that went through job descriptions and explained why they were not
devops or why they were unreasonable, but I can find it again.

* [The worst possible devops
  advise](https://ma.ttias.be/the-worst-possible-devops-advice/) goes into how
  broad devops can be and how it means different things to different people.
* [Life without ops](https://ma.ttias.be/life-without-ops/) some insight into how
  devops can't replace an ops team.
* [Developers with devops skill enjoy their work
  more](https://developer-tech.com/news/2020/apr/08/developers-working-with-mature-devops-practices-much-more-likely-to-enjoy-their-work/)
  covers how developers enjoy working in mature devops environments
* [How a brilliant platform engineer saved twilio from absolute
  disaster](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/platform-engineer-twilio-ask-your-developer-excerpt)
  lightly touches on devops and then goes into detail about more specific job
  titles that all practice devops principles, but have different focuses
  depending on what the company needs (platform engineer, SRE, release engineer,
  ...)

_disclaimer:_ This is not a techy post like the others. I mostly wrote this for myself to get
my thoughts in order. Why publish it? Because I believe that I'm not alone, and
if this post can help a single person (even if it's just the relief of not being
alone), it was worth it.

# Looking back, professionally

Sometimes you reach a point in life where you need to stop for a moment and look
back at what you have done. I believe it's time for me to do so, professionally.
So let's move on to what brought me here.

## Being lost, how I got here

When I graduated two years ago, I was at an impasse. For a long time, when people
asked me what I wanted to become, the answer was pretty simple "an engineer." So
here I was, a young graduate engineer with a single question: "now what?". I have
developed a healthy interest in computer science, communication protocols,
networking, and generally solving technical problems (with automation) in the
field I like to call "data brokering" (throwing data around between different
systems). This has led me to a student DevOps job which I continued working after
graduation. Combined with the pandemic at our front door, it was an easy decision
... a safe decision.

After a year, I started looking for a new challenge; instead of "DevOps" I wanted
to move on to a development job. I made a small detour over a service engineering
job (slight miscommunication) and eventually landed a Python backend development
job at a small company. Here I learned to work on some backend frameworks,
performance tuning on caches, and OAuth login flows.

At the end of 2021, I moved on again. My productivity was at a low. Over the
following months, I'll work as a DOCSIS test engineer and project engineer for a
government. I'm still at that last one, and it was a good decision to step away
from the IT world for a while. It made me realize that I do miss it, but I have
learned that I need short/mid-term projects because the reality is that ... I get
bored.

## Know thyself

People who know me will not be surprised about what I'm going to write now, and
it's easier to see these things looking in from the outside. Those same people
will have told me these things plenty of times before, and I was just too
ignorant to understand them.

I've avoided "consultancy" at the start. I still find the concept of taking young
graduates out of school straight into consulting a bit strange. Without
experience, what do you have to base that consultation on? The reality is,
consultancy would suit me. I need variation, challenges and new knowledge on a
semi-regular basis. It's all about learning things with me and whenever that
learning slows down, I get bored. I need variation in the actual "content" of
work and I also need it in the type of work. There needs to be space to do broad
architectural exploration; while still having opportunities to do real deep
technical dives.

The projects I work on need to have meaning and I need to care about them. Sure
there are plenty of technical issues to solve in business, but make it clear to
me what the goal is and how the impact will improve aspects of something and you
can get me on board to solve it. "You get paid" is not enough to keep me going
every day of the week. Have something that piques my interest and I'll probably
spend way too much time working on it.

Company and team cohesion are also essential. Having clear goals and a balanced
team that works together according to the same principles makes the challenging
moments easier (who else am I going to shitpost with when I can't get through a
problem?). With remote work being more accepted, it also helps if the team is on
the same page. I like remote work. Taking your laptop anywhere in the world and
world is great for me. If I stall in the workday, this can easily be fixed by
taking a walk to the coffee shop around the corner, getting a coffee and opening
the laptop in a new environment. Of course, this is only possible if the team
knows how to work asynchronously. Still, nothing beats throwing a bunch of people
together in a room with a whiteboard to work out some ideas, for those things,
I'll gladly go to the office.

## Where I'm going

I never stop keeping an eye on the job market; you never know what will come by.
And for the right opportunity, I'll probably switch jobs again. Maybe I'll even
look into becoming a freelancer in the future. It would give me the autonomy I
would prefer while being able to switch around the contents I workaround to
provide the variation. Being freelance comes with many extra things, though,
which I'm not sure I'm ready for now.

# My job timeline

I'm posting this online because I communicate openly about my jobs. First I found
it awkward to talk about them, but I've had positive feedback (also, A LOT OF
BANTER) about my transparency on them. People must know that not everybody comes
out of school and knows where they want to work. Or what job they want to do.
Other people think more about the jobs; I tend to learn through experience.

| time period  | job title | company |
|---|---|---|
| oct 2019 - dec 2020  | devops engineer/system administrator | RV |
| jan 2021 | services engineer | BN |
| feb 2021 - nov 2021 | backend developer | Vec |
| dec 2021 - feb 2022 | test engineer | Exc |
| mar 2022 - current | project engineer | VO |

Both professionally and personally, 2021 was NOT a good year for me. But in that
year, I have grown as a person regardless of the troubles I encountered. I aim to
not repeat that period in my life, but I am grateful for the people I had around
me and the jobs during that time.

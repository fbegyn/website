_disclaimer_: This is not a techy post like the others. I mostly wrote this for
myself to get my thoughts in order. Why publish it? Because I believe that I'm
not alone and if this post can help even a single person (even if it's just the
relief of not being alone), it was worth it.

# Looking back, professionally

Sometimes you reach a point in life where you need to stop for a moment and look
back at what you have done. I believed it's time for me to do so, professionally.
So let's move onto what brought me here.

## Being lost, how I got here

When I graduated 2 years ago, I was kinda at an impasse. For a long time, when
people asked me what I wanted to become, the answer was pretty simple "an
engineer". So here I was, a young graduate engineer with a single question: "now
what?". I had developed a healthy interrest in computer science, communication
protocols, networking and generally solving technical problems (with automation)
in the field I like to call "data brokering" (throwing data around between
different systems). This has led me to a student devops job at which I continued
working after graduation. Combined with the pandemic at our front door, it was an
easy decision ... a safe decision.

After a year I started looking for a new challenge, instead of "devops" I wanted
to move onto a development job. I made a small detour over a service engineering
job (slight miscommunication) and eventually landed a Python backend development
job at a tiny company. Here I learned to work on some backend frameworks and
learned a bit about performance tuning on caches and about OAuth login flows.

At the end of 2021 I moved on again, my productivity was at a low end. Over the
next months I'll end up working as a DOCSIS test engineer and project engineer
for a government. I'm still at that last one and it was a good decesion stepping
away from the IT world for a while. It made me realise that I do miss it, but I
have learned that I need short/mid term projects because the reality in most
cases is ... I get bored.

## Know thyself

People that know me will not be surprised about what I'm going to write now, it's
easier seeing these things looking in from the outside. Those same
people will have told me these things plenty of times before, I was just to
ignorant to understand them.

I've avoided "consultancy" at the start. I still find the concept of taking young
graduates out of school straight into consulting a bit strange. Without
experience, what do you have to base that consultation on? The reality is,
consultancy would suit me. I need variation, challenges and new knowledge on a
semi-regular basis. It's all about learning things with me and whenever that
learning slows down I get bored. Not only do I need variation in the actual
"content" of work, I also need it in the type of work. There needs to be space to
do broad architectual exploration, while still having opportunities to do real
deep technical dives.

The projects I work on need to have meaning and I need to care about them. Sure
there are plenty of technical issues to solve in business, but make it clear to
me what the goal is and how the impact will improve aspects of something and you
can get me on board to solve it. "You get payed" is simply not enough to keep me
going every day of the week. Have something that peaks my interest and I'll
probably spend way too much time working on it.

Company and team cohesion is also important. Having clear goals and a balanced
team that works together acoording to the same principles makes the though
moments just that little bit easier (who else am I gonna shitpost with when I
can't get through a problem?). With remote work being more accepted, it also
helps if the team is on the same page about this. For me personally I really like
remote work. Being able to just take your laptop anywhere in the world and word
is great for me. If I stall in the workday this can easily be fixed by taking a
walk to the coffee shop around the corner, getting a coffee and opening the
laptop in a new environment. This is only possible if the team knows how to work
asynchronously. Still, nothing beats throwing a bunch of people together in a
room with a whiteboard to work out some ideas, for those things I'll gladly go to
the office.

## Where I'm going

I never stop keeping an eye on the job market, you never know what will come by.
And for the right opportunity, I'll proablaby switch jobs again. Maybe I'll even
look into becoming a freelancer in the future. It would give me the autonomy I
would prefer, while being able to switch around the material I work around with
to provide the variation. Being freelance comes with a lot of extra things
though, which I'm not sure I'm ready for just now.

# My job timeline

I'm posting this online because I communicate openly about my jobs. First I found
it awkward to talk about them, but I've had positive feedback (also A LOT OF
BANTER) about my transparancy on them. It's important that people know that not
everybody comes out of school and knows where they wanna work. Or what job they
want to do. Other people think more about the jobs, I tend to learn through
experience.

| time period  | job title | company |
|---|---|---|
| oct 2019 - dec 2020  | devops engineer/system administrator | Robovision |
| jan 2021 | services engineer | Belnet |
| feb 2021 - nov 2021 | backend developer | Vectera |
| dec 2021 - feb 2022 | test engineer | Excentis |
| mar 2022 - current | project engineer | Flemmish Government |

Both professionally and personally 2021 was NOT a good year for me. But in that
year I have grown as a person regardless of the troubles I encountered. I aim to
not repeat that period in my life but am gratefull for the people I had around me
and the jobs during that time.

# Being lost, career edition

I'll start of by just saying this, I don't have answers for you if you came
here looking for one. But since you did came here, I'd ask you to keep reading,
since it might offer some comfort that you are not alone.

## How I got where I am

For the past few  months, I've been having a difficult time with my career and
what path I want to take. I graduated last year, right with the Corona pandemic
at the doorsteps. So I decided to play things safe, stick with the place that I
worked at as a student and hold out the pandemic. Nobody could have guessed the
duration of it, but few would have guessed that 18 months later, we'd still be in
it (although things are looking up).

After about a year, I started looking for companies to switch to. The company was
great, but I wanted to work on things that I'm very passionate about: mobility,
networking, infrastructure (both IT and non-IT) and work with programming
languages that I love. I send out a lot of emails, interviewed at plenty of
places. I rejected one job offer that had opportunity to be very diverse, which
was probably what I needed and refusing it was a mistake.

In the end, decided on a job that I got offered through an interview process at a
government department. This was my second mistake, I did not interview for it,
the process was very impromptu and some steps where skipped. I didn't do that job
very long, as I never got into the flow and started slipping from a somewhat less
than optimal mental state at the previous job, into a worse one. So I started
looking again and I decided to pick something out of my comfort state, pure
development as a backend developer. So far, my mental state has improved and I
learned some things along the way as well, which I always try to. But lately I
have this nagging feeling.

## Thought is frightening, but necessary

You'll always hear of people talking about the things they always wanted to be:
firemen, president, engineer, chef, store owner, ... and over the years these
change as they become older and start setting out on their career paths. I never
had that as far as I can remember. I knew what I wanted to study, but never what
I would become after that. I still can't think of that answer. For somebody at
the start of their career, this can be a problem. Interviewers sometimes ask
"where do you see yourself in 5 years?" and I'd used answer them that I want to
be solving problems that impact peoples lives on a daily basis, which is a
terrible answer IMHO since a keen observer would see that there is little
concrete substance to it. It doesn't show that I would like to be in some leading
postion with expert technical knowledge.

Which expert knowledge? Difficult to say, I dig into whatever subject matter that
I'm intrested in, but my formal education would indicate the wonderfull world of
ICT, embedded, IoT and software. But than I also hold keen intrest in
mobility and sustainability. So I'm looking for something where I can
combine all these.

## What's next?

As I mentioned, I'm in a good mental space and I'm learning where I currently am.
I think that's the metric that I'm gonna use for the moment: I need to enjoy what
I am doing and I need to be learning. If either of those 2 start being
unsatisfied, I'll start losing intrest and start slacking at work, which won't
benefit me.

I've also decided to trust my gut feeling a bit more. In the past I've somewhat
always withold myself. Afraid of being to forward or maybe just unsure of my
thoughts. A recent experience has learned me that I can trust my gut and that
thoughts are supposed to be shared.

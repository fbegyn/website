# Being lost, career edition

I'll start of by just saying this, I don't have answers for you if you came
here looking for one. But since you did came here, I'd ask you to keep reading,
since it might offer some comfort that you are not alone.

## How I got where I am

For the past few  months, I've been having a difficult time with my career and
what path I want to take. I graduated last year, right with the Corona pandemic
at the doorsteps. So I decided to play things safe, stick with the place that I
worked at as a student and hold out the pandemic. Nobody could have guessed the
duration of it, but few would have guessed that 18 months later, we'd still be in
it (although things are looking up).

After about a year, I started looking for companies to switch to. The company was
great, but I wanted to work on things that I'm very passionate about: mobility,
networking, infrastructure (both IT and non-IT) and work with programming
languages that I love. I send out a lot of emails, interviewed at plenty of
places. I rejected one job offer that had opportunity to be very diverse, which
was probably what I needed and refusing it was a mistake.

In the end, decided on a job that I got offered through an interview process at a
company. This was my second mistake, I did not interview for it, the process was
very impromptu and some steps where skipped. I didn't do that job very long, as I
never got into the flow and started slipping from a somewhat less than optimal
mental state at the previous job, into a worse one. So I started looking again
and I decided to pick something out of my comfort state, pure development as a
backend developer. So far, my mental state has improved and I learned some things
along the way as well. But lately I have this nagging feeling.

## Taking some time to think

This nagging feeling has got me thinking again. What do I actually want to do as
a job and how can I get there, without compromising too much on the other aspects
I want in my life. So I took a week of for a staycation in my own town, trying
out different styles of working and which one works te best for me.

Some people just know what they want to do in life, very concretely. At some
point they knew how to answer the question "what do you want to be?". I've come
to realize that I didn't interpret that question correctly. I used to answer "an
engineer" because I like solving concrete problems. Spoiler alert: I'm now an
engineer and I don't know what I should do in life. Or more specific, I don't
know what job I should do.

I have a very broad field of interests, I dig into whatever subject matter that I
find interesting at any time. My formal education is about embedded systems, IoT
and ICT, but I've also always had an interest in mobility, sustainability and
biomedical sciences. I used to believe that for a job, you should pick something
that matches an interest and go with it. But lately I've come to realise that is
it more important that the problems the job is trying to solve are within those
fields of interest.

## How to work

For that past few days, I've been experimenting with some different styles of
work. Work from home, work in a "office" based environment or (what I believe to
be) full remote style. I did this for my own projects, so things I really like
doing.

_Work from home_: This means that most of the time you work from home within the
normal office hours, sometimes you go the office to "bond" with people and handle
meetings. The same rythm as the office still holds: standups, meetings,
sychronous communication. This is the style that we use at the job now. Lately,
some days we go back to the office, but generally most of the time is spend at
home. This was working for me: there is some extra personal time (no commute) and
during the normal breaks there is space to do personal tasks (groceries, meal
prep, sport, ...), but the synchronous work flow leaves not enough space to
completely work at your own pace and in your own time. But a couple of weeks ago
productivity fell to the ground, tasks were getting slow, I started making
excuses and I was becoming annoyed at myself. Even my own projects suffered from
this. All sort of motivation for "productive" things was gone. Clearly, this was
not working so I didn't do this during my time off.

_Office style_: This is the "classic" work style. Within office hours people go
to a place and work there together. It generally has some facilities available to
the people. Before the pandemic I worked like this for a couple of weeks and I
tried it again (I spent a couple days going to a coworking space). Conclussion: I
dislike office settings. I dislike the time needed to go to them, I dislike the
atmosphere in a lot of them, I dislike the interruptions they cause and I hate
the layouts of most them. They require me to wear headphones, since the sounds
are not background noise that easily fades away (phones going off, door opening
and closing, coffee machines grinding away, ...). Sometimes you need to wait to
get tea/coffee or for a bathroom break. Flex desks might be great, but it's no
fun having to clean up after somebody. I think I can rant on for a while about
offices.

_My idea of remote_: Work happens more asynchronous here. There are tasks that
need to be done by the end of the day a progress should be made, but it matters
that it gets done, not when it gets done. Progress is logged centrally so people
can see what happens and pick it up when I'm not working on it. Synchronous
meetings do still happen, but they are planned ahead and have concrete agendas
for them. The people are there to do something, they aren't there when it doesn't
matter for them. This leaves a lot of room for personal time and tasks. It also
comes with the added benefit of being able to work anywhere anytime. I can spend
a morning at home, working or doing chores, but I might as well spend a morning
in the local coffee bar around the corner. Or I can be somewhere in the
mountains, enjoying the views while working. Or it can be the middle of the night
when I can't sleep.

For me (and I think from my writing) it's clear what I prefer: it's the remote
one. I've started working on my personal projects again, picked up the slack on
the volunteering that I do and even started writing these blog posts again. All
things that I have not done productively and succesfully over the past 3 months.

## What's next?

As my time off is coming to an end, I'm gonna have to start looking to work this
remote model into the job that I have at the moment. No more sitting on the
side line waiting for opportunities to appear. I'm gonna pitch some ideas to the
company and see what comes from it. If they don't work out, maybe I should start
looking for a job that allows me to do these things.

I've also decided to trust my gut feeling a bit more. In the past I've somewhat
always withold myself. Afraid of being to forward or maybe just unsure of my
thoughts. A recent experience has learned me that I can trust my gut and that
thoughts are supposed to be shared.

I also think that there is some stuff that I could do better than what is out
there already. So maybe, just maybe I finally bite the bullet and start the
freelance job that I've been wanting to do for a very long time. Take a shot at
it and see where it ends up in a couple of months.

In the end I'm glad to have taken some REAL time to reflect back on my life and
where I am at the moment. Regardless of what comes next, I have a better idea of
where I want to go.

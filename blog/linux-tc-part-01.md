# Linux TC - part 01

I've been working with Linux TC the past months for a personal project of mine.
So I thought is was about time to write some blog posts about it. Since it's such
a big topic, I'll probably make it a multi-part blog.

## Linux TC what ?

The wikipedia entry for Linux TC defines Linux TC as:

> tc (traffic control) is the user-space utility program used to configure the
> Linux kernel packet scheduler. Tc is usually packaged as part of the
> iproute2 package.

Well ... that doesn't tell us much. Let's take a look at this Linux kernel packet
scheduler.

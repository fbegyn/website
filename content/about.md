I'm a 22-year-old belgian electrical engineering student at the Ghent University. I'm also active in multiple event organistations mainly as a logistical/technical person. To relax, I play some guitar or tinker with linux machines.

The blog I have here is something to air my rants and to keep "guides" (for the lack of a better word) for some of the things that I do. They are by no means meant to be toturials.
If you have any questions about any thing in the blog, please contact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/fbegyn).

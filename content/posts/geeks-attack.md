So this week I'll be prepping for the lan party of the computer science student group. Always free to [come say hey](https://zeus.gent/events/18-19/lan/).
I have some experience with linux machines and networks, so I'll be functioning as a sysadmin during the lan as well.
What does all of this entail? It means I'll be one of the people responsible for maintaining and running the network and all the game servers.

# Network

The network is pretty basic. Some 24/16/8 port switches for the participants and an Edgerouter Pro as the gateway. The network connection is pretty fast, but a little bit spotty from time to time (yay :( ).
The Edgerouter has some good functionality, and maybe I'll play a bit with to see what I can do to improve the network quality a bit.

# Servers

We don't have fancy servers to do a a lot of fancy things with, but we make due with what we have. And we give them cool name like King, Cable, Gyrid, ... .
The servers will be running game servers for the games we host compos for, but also some fun games. Things like Terraria, Minecraft, Factorio, ... will also be hosted.
